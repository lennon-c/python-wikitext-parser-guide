## A Hands-On Workshop on Parsing Wikitext
[PyCon Austria](https://pycon.pyug.at/en/)
6 and 7 April 2025 | Eisenstadt

In this workshop, you will learn how to fetch, parse, and extract data from the _German Wiktionary_ to gather linguistic information such as parts of speech, inflections, example sentences, and definitions. You will also learn where to find the data and how to process it using HTTP requests, as well as XML and Wikitext parsers.

## Using Google Colab

In this workshop, we will use **Google Colab**, a free, cloud-based platform for running Python code in a Jupyter Notebook environment. 

**Follow these steps to get started:**

1. Make sure you are signed in with your **Google account**.
2. Ensure that you have an active **Internet connection** on your device.
3. You can follow and run the code on a tablet, but if you'd like to **edit** on the go, I recommend using a laptop for a smoother experience.
4. To access the workshop material, simply click the links provided in the **guide table of contents**.

## Running on Your Own Machine
 
If you prefer not to use Google Colab but still want to participate in the workshop, you can download the source code and run it on your local machine.

To get started, make sure you install the necessary dependencies for the workshop:

- [`requests`](https://pypi.org/project/requests/), [`lxml`](https://lxml.de/) and [`mwparserfromhell`](https://github.com/earwig/mwparserfromhell)

```
pip install requests lxml mwparserfromhell
```
